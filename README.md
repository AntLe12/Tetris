# Tetris
 My recreation of Tetris in vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
 
 Controls (keyboard only):
  - A or left arrow key moves the piece to the left
  - D or right arrow key moves the piece to the right
  - S or down arrow key moves the piece down
  - W or up arrow key rotates the piece 90 degrees counterclockwise
